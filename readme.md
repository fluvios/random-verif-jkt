## 🚀 Features

- **OAuth2 Authentication:**
  - Secure endpoints with JWT tokens.
  - Tokens have a validity period (2 hours).

- **Priority-Based Selection:**
  - Prioritizes attendees based on multiple factors:
    - Nearest location (simplified).
    - Number of previous losses.
    - Theater popularity (number of applicants).
    - Matching favorite members performing in the theater.

- **Special Event Handling:**
  - Increased verification probability for:
    - Attendees who've lost ≥10 times.
    - Attendees favoring members having birthdays or last shows.

- **Two distinct selection endpoints:**
  - OFC attendees.
  - General attendees (balanced percentage-based selection).

- **Attendance Tracking and Penalties:**
  - Attendees who verify but fail to attend receive penalties in future selections.
  - Encourages reliable attendance.
